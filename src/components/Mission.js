				$Suck Token is launching to propel the first ever Suckiverse. Youâ€™ve heard of Software as a service, Play to Earn, and the
				metaverse. Now get ready for the first ever Sucking as a Service metaverse project. The Suckiverse allows you to get sucked off in
				the metaverse through advanced teledildonics that reward participants through Suck-to-Earn (S2E) blockchain mechanics.

				A one of a kind revolutionary concept allowing people from all over the world to be sucked off at once, stimulating the global
				economy.
